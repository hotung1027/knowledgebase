# Work in Progress
---
## Previous Working
- [ ] Researching on beam pattern optimization
- [ ] Fail to solve inequality constraint on reducing side lobe level
- [ ] Questionable on Both Azimuth and Elevation Constraint, although the plot shown the constraint is feasible
- [ ] Finding other way for beam pattern
--- 
## Today
- [x] Apply Taper to suppress the side lobe
- [x] Analysis the beam steer symmetric angle, and study the minimum and maximum angle without target confusion
- [ ] Minimal Frequency baseband for oscilloscope resolution
- [ ] Minimal Sampling Rate for Matched Filter resolution SNR
- [ ] Spectrogram for FMCW
- [ ] Configurating lwip/tcpip timerinterupt for dhcp routine
- [ ] Debug Xscugic handler for GPIO, maybe conflict with outher handler with redeinfer handler.

# Goal 
Produce a focused beam to scan the azimuth angle without null space
- [ ] Suppress Interference, Side lobe
- [ ] ADC on FPGA

# Worth Trying
- [x] Change the antenna element to synthesis one, instead of given micro inserted one
- [ ]  Show the correct concept of receiving side beam forming, with animation. 

# To-Do
- [x] Matched Filter (FPGA)
- [ ] ADC (FPGA)
- [ ] DOA of MUSIC Algorithm
