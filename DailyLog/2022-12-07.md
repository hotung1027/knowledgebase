# Work in Progress
---
## Previous Working
- [ ] Refactor the ADC program previously working by Tiger
--- 
## Today
- [x] Apply Taper to suppress the side lobe
- [x] Analysis the beam steer symmetric angle, and study the minimum and maximum angle without target confusion
- [x] Configurating lwip/tcpip timerinterupt for dhcp routine
- [x] Debug Xscugic handler for GPIO, maybe conflict with outher handler with redeinfer handler.
- [x] Refactor code of interrupts and variable sharing

# Goal 
- [ ] ADC on FPGA
- [ ] Documenting Project

# Worth Trying
- [x] Change the antenna element to synthesis one, instead of given micro inserted one
- [ ]  Show the correct concept of receiving side beam forming, with animation. 
- [ ] DMA Scatter Gather Engine for higher throughput 
- [ ] LVDS interface for long range noise rejecting communication

# To-Do
- [x] Matched Filter (FPGA)
- [ ] ADC (FPGA)
- [ ] CMOS Interface communication from FPGA
