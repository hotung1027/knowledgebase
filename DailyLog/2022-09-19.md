# Work in Progress
- Researching on beam pattern optimization
- Fail to solve inequality constraint on reducing side lobe level
- Questionable on Both Azimuth and Elevation Constraint, although the plot shown the constraint is feasible
- Finding other way for beam pattern

# Goal 
1. Produce a focused beam to scan the azimuth angle without null space
- Suppress Interference, Side lobe

# Worth Trying
- Change the antenna element to synthesis one, instead of given micro inserted one
-  Show the correct concept of receiving side beam forming, with animation.
