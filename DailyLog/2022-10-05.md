# Work in Progress
---
## Previous Working
- [ ] Researching on beam pattern optimization
- [ ] Fail to solve inequality constraint on reducing side lobe level
- [ ] Questionable on Both Azimuth and Elevation Constraint, although the plot shown the constraint is feasible
- [ ] Finding other way for beam pattern
--- 
## Today
- [x] Apply Taper to suppress the side lobe
- [x] Analysis the beam steer symmetric angle, and study the minimum and maximum angle without target confusion
- [ ] Matched Filter (FPGA)
- [ ] Fixed scale of FFT input to Fixed Point \[-1,1\]
# Goal 
Produce a focused beam to scan the azimuth angle without null space
- [x] Suppress Interference, Side lobe

Matched Filter
- [ ] Overlap add/save method
- [ ] Vector FFT
- [ ]

# Worth Trying
- [x] Change the antenna element to synthesis one, instead of given micro inserted one
- [x]  Show the correct concept of receiving side beam forming, with animation. 

# To-Do

- [ ] ADC (FPGA)
- [ ] DOA of MUSIC Algorithm
